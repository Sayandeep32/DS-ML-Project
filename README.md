📧 Spam/Ham Email Classifier
This project is a real-time email classification web app that detects whether a given message is SPAM or HAM (not spam) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Logistic Regression.

It leverages TF-IDF vectorization to convert text data into numerical features and uses a Logistic Regression model to classify messages. The model is deployed using Streamlit, providing a simple and interactive user interface.
